      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        This website ranks Celeste speedrunners by an accumulated score from all
        their Individual Level times, largely inspired by
        <a href="https://www.the-elite.net/">the-elite.net</a>. For the data
        source, it uses
        <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/celeste/levels">speedrun.com</a> and
        its REST API.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is pretty basic right now, by design. With enough interest, I can see
        myself investing more time to make it prettier and add features. And of
        course it is open source, you are free to submit your own changes via a
        PR.

      <h2>Ranking</h2>
      <p>
        The ranking algorithm works like this for each IL board:
        <br />
        1st gets 100 points, 2nd gets 97 points, 3rd gets 95 points - and from
        there its linear, meaning 4th gets 94 points and so on. All individual
        scores are summed up for each player, resulting in their final point
        count.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note: </b>Farewell is considered an A-Side in this context. Also,
        Collectible runs use the Full Clear subcategory.
