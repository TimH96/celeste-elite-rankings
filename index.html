For the data source, it uses <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/celeste/levels">speedrun.com</a> and its REST API. </p> <p> It is pretty basic right now, by design. With enough interest, I can see myself investing more time to make it prettier and add features. And of course it is open source, you are free to submit your own changes via a PR. <a href="https://github.com/TimH96/celeste-elite-rankings">Here is the repository</a>. </p> <h2>Ranking</h2> <p> The ranking algorithm works like this for each IL board: <br> 1st gets 100 points, 2nd gets 97 points, 3rd gets 95 points - and from there its linear, meaning 4th gets 94 points and so on. All individual scores are summed up for each player, resulting in their final point count. </p> <p> <b>Note: </b>Farewell is considered an A-Side in this context. Also, Collectible/Full Clear runs are unfortunately not considered at all because the <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/celeste/levels">speedrun.com</a> API is very limited around subcategories. If you find a succinct way to incorporate them, let me know ASAP! </p> <h2>Leaderboard</h2> <div id="dynamic-container"></div> <div id="footer"></div> </div> <script src="src.c273760d.js"></script> </body></html>
